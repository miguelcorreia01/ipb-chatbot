The Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (IPB) is a Portuguese Higher Education
Public Institution with 9000 undergraduate and master students, embracing a
wide area of knowledge and technology, including agriculture sciences, arts
and sports, education and teachers’ training, informatics and engineering,
administration and management, health, communication and tourism.  
The IPB belongs to the European Network for Universities of Applied Sciences
(UASnet), which main objectives include the transferability of professional
skills and the integration of applied research in their professional and
technological education mission. IPB has also an internationalization
programme with widely recognized success, including the annual mobility of
more than 900 incoming and outgoing students and 300 teaching staff members,
as the result of the collaboration with several higher education institutions
from all over the World. Nowadays the IPB is a multicultural institution,
where 33% of its students are international students.  
In 2011, the European Commission has awarded the ECTS Label to the IPB,
acknowledging the quality of the information provided in terms of the degree
programmes offered and the management of student mobility within the European
Higher Education Area. In 2013, IPB has been awarded also the DS Label. The
purpose of the Diploma Supplement (DS) is to provide sufficient independent
data to improve the international transparency and fair academic and
professional recognition of qualifications.  
**Besides the academic programmes taught in the Portuguese language, the IPB
also offers bachelor and master programmes fully lectured in English, as well
as Portuguese language and culture courses for foreign students.**
